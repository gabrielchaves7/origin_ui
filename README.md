# Origin UI
---

## Getting Started üöÄ
### Overview
The project aims to helps people putting their financial lives on track. To achieve this, we offer a tool to calculate person financial wellness based on person analyzing annual income and monthly costs. 

--- 
### Flutter
The first thing you need is to setup flutter, please follow the steps: 
1. https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor

### Running the project
This project has 3 environments:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired environment either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --target lib/main_development.dart --web-port=8080

# Staging
$ flutter run --target lib/main_staging.dart --web-port=8080

# Production
$ flutter run --target lib/main_production.dart --web-port=8080
```
---
## Running Tests üß™

### Unit tests

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

### Integration tests
1. To run the integration tests locally on your machine you will first need to run the origin-api. You can do this following the README of the project. 
2. Then download chromedriver:
     https://chromedriver.chromium.org
3. After the download complete, open the folder and run chromedriver at port 4444 on your machine: 
    ```./chromedriver --port=4444```
4. Run the integrations tests:
    ```flutter -d chrome drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/main_test.dart --web-port=8080```

---

## Continuous Integration ü§ñ
On each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link] for Code coverage.

---
## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Localizations

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

2. Run the command to generate the new string :
```flutter gen-l10n```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:origin_ui/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

## Architecture and structure decisions
The project architecture aims to separete the UI from the domain. The code under **/lib** folder is only responsible components and state management.

All the code related with the domain (bussiness logic, api calls, json parse...) is under **/packages/domain** (check its readme too). Since the domain is a package, we can reuse it on other projects and more important than this, since the UI only knows the use cases it`s easier to change our domain layer.

There is also another important package, **origin_design_system** , which contains the design system for the project, following the atomic design pattern. The design system enable to reuse the components on every new or old project keeping the same standard.

### Next steps
1. Add error monitoring and logging to the project.
2. Setup firebase for analytics
3. Feature flags
